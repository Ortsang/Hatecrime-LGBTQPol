# Data Folder

This folder contains the datasets used in the research study on hate crime, mental health, and LGBTQ politicians. The data is divided into raw, unprocessed data and cleaned, processed datasets.

Not all datasets will be stored in the Github, given the data limit. The origin location will be indicated if the dataset can not be uploaded or restored
